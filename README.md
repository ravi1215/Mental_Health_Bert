git clone https://github.com/ravi1215/Mental_Health_Bert.git
cd Mental_Health_Bert
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Training:

Detailed instructions for training the model on your dataset are available in the repository's documentation. This includes data preprocessing steps, model configuration, and training scripts.
Fine-Tuning BERT for Anxiety and Depression Classification
Fine-tuning BERT for mental health text classification involves training the model on a dataset containing text samples labeled as indicative of anxiety, depression, or other mental health conditions. This process enables the model to learn domain-specific patterns and nuances, improving its accuracy in identifying mental health-related content.

Steps to Fine-Tune BERT:

Dataset Preparation:

Collect a dataset comprising text samples labeled for anxiety, depression, or other relevant categories.
Ensure the dataset is balanced to prevent bias towards any particular class.
Data Preprocessing:

Tokenize the text data using the BERT tokenizer.
Convert tokens to input IDs and create attention masks to indicate padding.
Model Configuration:

Load the pre-trained BERT model with a classification head.
Configure the model for the specific number of classes in your dataset.
Training:

Train the model on the prepared dataset, monitoring performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Implement techniques like early stopping to prevent overfitting.
Evaluation:

Evaluate the model on a separate validation or test set to assess its generalization capability.

# Mental_Health_Bert

Mental_Health_Bert is a repository dedicated to developing and deploying a BERT-based model tailored for mental health applications. The project leverages the BERT architecture to analyze and understand mental health-related text data, aiming to enhance early detection and intervention strategies.

Key Features:

BERT Architecture: Utilizes the BERT model, a transformer-based architecture known for its effectiveness in natural language understanding tasks.

Mental Health Focus: Specifically trained on mental health-related datasets to improve the model's performance in this domain.

Early Detection: Aims to assist in the early identification of mental health issues through text analysis.

Usage:

To utilize the model, clone the repository and follow the setup instructions provided in the documentation. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed, such as the Hugging Face Transformers library.

Installation:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/ravi1215/Mental_Health_Bert.git
cd Mental_Health_Bert
pip install -r requirements.txt
Training:

Detailed instructions for training the model on your dataset are available in the repository's documentation. This includes data preprocessing steps, model configuration, and training scripts.

Contributing:

Contributions are welcome. Please fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request. Ensure that your contributions align with the project's goals and adhere to the coding standards outlined in the contributing guidelines.
